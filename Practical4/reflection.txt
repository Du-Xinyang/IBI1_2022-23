# Second note from 7/1/21, I managed to get changes on the ZJE server onto GitHub but can I make changes on the website and send them back?

# Note from 7/1/21, I have cloned this repo onto the ZJE server and am now going to attempt to push it back onto GitHub.

This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2019-20.

During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!
I had trouble git push orgin master and found that the problem was that there's no tracking information for the current branch, so I set tracking information for master branch by typing git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master.Although I don't know the exact meaning of the command,I successfully solved the problem.
I also got an access token because it said that the authentical access was removed in 2021,qwq.
